The citizens had two main goals in this world: first to conquer the surrounding landscapes and connected realms, and secondly to get home to their home, finally at peace, their Egghole.</p>

                In the Season of Good Neighbors, players united around the tale of the Hexacomb. A democratic system formed amid pixelated villages, facing occasional strains. Fueled by economic dynamics and occasional conflicts, the community remained devoted to the Hexacombâ€”a mysterious entity serving as both life-bringer and seeker of safer worlds. Through ups and downs, the season showcased the resilience of a community bound by shared adventures and reverence for the enigmatic Hexacomb.</p>
